_Here are some Markdown Basics..._
## What is Markdown?
Markdown is just a formatting syntax, so that people can use plain-text editors to publish rich text documents that look prettier (usually in HTML)
## How do I use Markdown:
_Use one underscore to italicize_

__Use two underscores to bold__

Use backticks to represent `code().itSeems -> yay!` in monospace with gray background

* You can use an astericks to make bullets
